# Michael Jackson – Give In to Me

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Give
Give in to me
Give in, give in, give in, give in to me

Oh my love
Give me your body
Talk to me
Tell me you want me

Come to me now
Open your mind
Secrets we'll share with each other

These moments we should keep
Locked forever in our sleep
Kiss, promise left untrue
Nothing here but me and you

Give
Give in to me
Give in, give in, give in, give in to me

Can't you hear
Softly I'm calling
Lay with me
I'll show you the morning
Violet to blue
I think of you
Whispering softly
You want me

These moments we should keep
Locked forever in our sleep
Kiss, promise left untrue
Nothing here but me and you

Give
Give in to me
Give in, give in, give in, give in to me

Give
Give in to me
Give in, give in, give in, give in to me

These moments we should keep
Locked forever in our sleep
Kiss, promise left untrue
Nothing here but me and you

Give
Give in to me
Give in, give in, give in, give in to me
