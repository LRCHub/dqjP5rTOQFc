she always takes it
with a heart of stone
'cause all she does is
throw it back to me
I've spend a lifetime
looking for someone
don't try to understand me
just simply do the
things I say
love is a feeling
give it when I want it
'cause I'm on fire
quench my desire
give it when I want it
talk to me woman
give in to me
give in to me
you always knew just
how to make me cry
and never did I ask you
questions why
it seems you get your kicks
from hurting me
don't try to understand me
because your words
just aren't enough
love is a feeling
quench my desire
give it when I want it
takin' me higher
love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
give in to me
give in to me
you and your friends
were laughing at me
in town
but it's okay
and it's okay
you wont be laughing girl
when I'm not around
I'll be okay
and i'll, I'll not find
gotta, the peace of mind no
<♪>
don't try to tell me
because your words
just aren't enough
love is a feeling
quench my desire
give it when I want it
takin' me higher
talk to me woman
love is a feeling
give in to me
give in to me
give in to me
love is the feeling
I don't wanna hear it
quench my desire
takin' me higher
tell it to the preacher
satisfy the feeling
give in to me
give in to me
<♪>
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
hear it
give it to the fire
talk to me woman
quench my desire
I don't like a lady
talk to me baby
give in to me
give in to the fire
give in to me
give in to me
give in to me
love is a woman
give in to me
give in to me
give in to me
give in to me
'cause I'm on fire
talk to me woman
quench my desire
give it to the feeling
